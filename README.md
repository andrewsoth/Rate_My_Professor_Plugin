# Rate_My_Professor_Plugin

This is a chrome extension developed for the students at CSULB. The extension only works within the class search on myCSULB.

 ***HOW TO USE*** 

 Download the files and unload them into your chrome extensions in developer mode. Log into myCSULB and search for classes, and then open the CSULB RMP chrome extension form and click Update. The professors' names should now be clickable.
